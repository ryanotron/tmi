TODO:
- make timezones consistent for the user
- format time properly in userpage
- mockup a good userpage
- store all time in UTC
- specify date for events/activity, give shortcut to today and yesterday
- rewrite everything nicely:
  - handlers which are _writing_ to the database should be called receptor
  - handlers which are only _reading_ the database should be called fetcher
  - accept forms in user's timezone, but store in UTC
  - serve things in user's timezone
  - make general fetchers for all the tables
    - how to handle filters? userid is mandatory as a user isn't allowed to fetch another user's data,
      but suppose sometimes I want to fetch specific activities within a time period, and other times
      I want to fetch all activities within a time period!
  - as much as possible, pass objects to template, not raw strings

REWRITE EVERYTHING
